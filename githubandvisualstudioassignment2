Introduction to GitHub:
GitHub is a web-based platform that combines version control and collaborative software development using Git. Here’s what you need to know:

Version Control with Git:
Git allows you to track changes in your code over time.
GitHub builds on Git, providing a user-friendly interface for managing repositories, collaborating, and sharing code.
Repositories (Repos):
A repository is a central place where all project files are stored.
To create a new repository:
GitHub Website: Go to your GitHub account, click “New,” and follow the prompts.
Git Command Line: Use git init to initialize a local repository.
Branches:
Branches isolate changes for specific features or experiments.
Create a branch using git checkout -b branch-name.
Make changes, commit them, and merge back into the main branch.
Pull Requests (PRs):
PRs facilitate code reviews and collaboration.
Steps:
Create a branch.
Make changes.
Push the branch to GitHub.
Open a PR.
Review and merge.
GitHub Actions:
Automate workflows (CI/CD pipelines).
Example: Set up a workflow to build and test your code on every push.
Introduction to Visual Studio:
Visual Studio (VS) is an integrated development environment (IDE) with powerful features:

Key Features:
Code editing, debugging, and testing.
Project management and collaboration tools.
Extensions for various languages and platforms.
Difference from Visual Studio Code (VS Code):
VS is a full-featured IDE, while VS Code is a lightweight code editor.
Integrating GitHub with Visual Studio:
Linking Repositories:
In VS, go to Team Explorer > Manage Connections > Connect to GitHub.
Authenticate and select your repository.
Enhanced Workflow:
VS provides seamless integration with Git and GitHub.
You can commit, push, and pull directly from the IDE.
Debugging in Visual Studio:
VS offers robust debugging tools:
Set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code.
Use the “Debug” menu or keyboard shortcuts.
Collaborative Development:
Combine GitHub and VS for effective collaboration:
Multiple developers can work on branches and PRs.
Real-world example: A team building a web app collaborates using GitHub for version control and VS for coding and debugging
